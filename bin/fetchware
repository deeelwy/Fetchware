=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTION SUBROUTINES

Below are all of subroutines that implement fetchware's main command line
options such as C<fetchware install> or C<fetchware new> and so on. These main
subroutines are called based on the options you pass to fetchware from the
command line.

=head2 cmd_install()

cmd_install() implements fetchware's install command, which installs a package
based on the specified Fetchwarefile or fetchware package. If no filename was
provided or the filename doesn't exist then, cmd_install() calls new() to create
and install a new fetchware package.

=head2 new()

new() implements fetchware's new command. See L<whereeverthehell> for detailed
documentation for the specifics of the new command. This chunk of POD is about
its implementation. new() calls a bunch of helper subroutines that implement the
algorithm fetchware uses to build new Fetchwarefiles automagically for the user.
The algorithm is dead stupid:

=over
=item 1. Ask for lookup_url & download it.
=item 2. Analyze the contents of the output from the lookup_url.
=item 3. Build the Fetchwarefile according to the output.
=item 4. Ask other questions as needed.
=back

new() uses Term::UI, which in turn uses Term::ReadLine to implement the
character basesd question and anwser wizard interface.

Fetchware's heart and soul is its lookup_url. This is the configuration option
that tells fetchware where to check if a new version of fetchware is released.

How to determine your application's lookup_url:
    1. Go to your application's Web site.
    2. Determine the download link for the latest version and copy it with
       CTRL-C or right-click it and select "copy".
    3. Paste the download link into your browser's URL Location Bar.
    4. Delete the filename from the location by starting at the end and deleting
       everything to the left until you reach a slash '/'.
       * ftp://a.url/downloads/program.tar.gz -> ftp://a.url/downloads/
    5. Press enter to access the directory listing on your Application's mirror
       site.
    6. If the directory listing in either FTP or HTTP format is displayed in
       your browser, then Fetchware's default, built-in lookup fuctionality will
       probably work properly. Copy and paste this URL into the prompt below, and
       Fetchware will download and analyze your lookup_url to see if it will work
       properly. If you do not end up with a browser directory listing, then
       please see Fetchware's documentation using perldoc App::Fetchware.

EOS
        my $what_a_filter_is = <<EOA;
Fetchware needs you to provide a filter option, which is a filter that fetchware
compares each file in the directory listing of your lookup_url to to determine
which version of your program to install.

For example, Apache's lookup_url has three versions in the same lookup_url
directory listing. These are 2.3, 2.2, and 2.0. Without the filter option
fetchware would choose the highest, which would be 2.3, which is in beta.
Chances are you do not want to replace your stable 2.2 apache with a beta
release. Therefore, fetchware needs a filter option. In apache's case simply
answering:
2.2
will result in fetchware filtering the results of its lookup check through your
filter of 2.2 causing fetchware to choose the latest version from the 2.2 stable
branch instead of the higher version numbered 2.3 beta or 2.0 legacy releases.

Note: fetchware does accept any valid perl regular expresion as an acceptable
filter option, but that should only be needed for advanced users. See perldoc
fetchware.

fetchware is a package manager for source code distributions. It gives you the
ability to install, uninstall, and even upgrade your source code distributions
just like you can with your binary packages using yum, apt-get, or slackpkg.

To create a new package just use fetchware's "new" command such as:
	$ fetchware new
And then answer the questions as best you can while fetchware takes your
answers and creates a Fetchwarefile for you. If your program's needs seem to
exceed the ability of fetchware's q&a configuration see perldoc App::Fetchware
for instructions on further customization.

USAGE:
###BUGALERT### Double check man page formatting standards!!!!!
	fetchware install|uninstall|upgrade|upgrade-all|help
		[--help|-h|-?|--version|-V|--verbose|-v|--quiet|-q]
		package-name
###BUGALERT### Double check man page formatting standards!!!!!
COMMANDS:
	install - installs a fetchware package, which is a .tar.gz ending with
		.fpkg, which includes the source code distribution unmodified,
		but with an included Fetchwarefile. See perldoc fetchware.
	uninstall - uninstalls a fetchware package.
	upgrade - upgrades a fetchware package if a newer version is available.
	upgrade-all - upgrades *all* installed fetchware packages.
	help - prints this help message
OPTIONS:
	--help|-h|-? - prints this help message.
	--version|-V - prints a version message.
	--verbose|-v - prints additional logging information.
	--quiet|-q - prints *no* logging invormation. Determine success or
		failure with fetchware's exit status. 0 = success. Non-zero = failure.
    --dry-run|-d - turns on dry run functionality causing fetchware to not
    actually download or install or create any packages.

For more information see perldoc fetchware and perldoc App::Fetchware.

$fetchwarefile_path argument to the fethware package that is created.

Returns the full pathname to the fetchware package that was created.
