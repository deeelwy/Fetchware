=head1 LOGGING SUBROUTINES

These subroutines' log messages generated by fetchware by printing them to
C<STDOUT>. They do not currently support logging to a file directly, but you
could redirect fetchware's standard output to a file using your shell if you
want to:

    fetchware <some fetchware command> any arguments > fetchware.log
    fetchware upgrade-all > fetchware.log

=cut 


=head2 Standards for using msg() and vmsg()

msg() should be used to describe the main events that happen, while vmsg()
should be used to describe what all of the main subroutine calls do.

For example, cmd_uninstall() has a msg() at the beginning and at the end, and so
do the main App::Fetchware subroutines that it uses such as start(), download(),
unarchive(), end() and so on. They both use vmsg() to add more detailed messages
about the particular even "internal" things they do.

msg() and vmsg() are also used without parens due to their appropriate
prototypes. This makes them stand out from regular old subroutine calls more.

=cut

=head2 msg()

    msg 'message to print to STDOUT' ;
    msg('message to print to STDOUT');

msg() simply takes a list of scalars, and it prints them to STDOUT according to
any verbose (-v), or quiet (-q) options that the user may have provided to
fetchware.

msg() will still print its arguments if the user provided a -v (verbose)
argument, but it will B<not> print its argument if the user provided a -q (quiet)
command line option.

=over
=item This subroutine makes use of prototypes, so that you can avoid using parentheses around its args to make it stand out more in code.

=back

###BUGALERT### Add Test::Wrap support to msg() and vmsg() so that they will

=head2 vmsg()

    vmsg 'message to print to STDOUT' ;

vmsg() simply takes a list of scalars, and it prints them to STDOUT according to

fetchware.

=head1 EXTERNAL COMMAND SUBROUTINES

run_prog() should be the B<only> function you use to execute external commands
when you L<extend your Fetchwarefile>, or L<write a fetchware extension>,
because run_prog() properly checks if the user specified the quiet switch
(C<-q>), and disables external commands from printing to C<STDOUT> if it has
been enabled.

=cut


=head2 run_prog()

    run_prog($program, @args);

    # Or let run_prog() deal with splitting the $command into multiple pieces.
    run_prig($command);

run_prog() uses L<system> to execute the program for you. Only the secure way of
avoiding the shell is used, so you can not use any shell redirection or any
shell builtins.

If the user ran fetchware with -v (verbose) then run_prog() changes none of its
behavior it still just executes the program. However, if the user runs the
program with -q (quiet) specified, then the the command is run using a piped
open to capture the output of the program. This captured output is then ignored,
because the user asked to never be bothered with the output. This piped open
uses the safer shell avoiding syntax on systems with L<fork>, and systems
without L<fork>, Windows,  the older less safe syntax is used. Backticks are
avoided, because they always use the shell.

run_prog() when called with only one argument will split that one argument into
multiple pieces using L<Text::ParseWords> quotewords() subroutine, which
properly deals with quotes just like the shell does. quotewords() is always used
even if you provide an already split up list of arguments to run_prog().

=cut

    my (@args) = @_;

=head2 Executing external commands without using run_prog()

Subify the -q checking code, and paste it below, and tell users to use that if
they want to use something else, and document the $fetchware::quiet variable for
other users too.

msg(), vmsg(), and run_prog() determine if -v and if -q were specified by
checking the values of the global variables listed below:

=over

=item * $fetchware::quiet - is C<0> if -q was B<not> specified.
=item * $fetchware::verbose - is C<0> if -v was B<not> specified.

=back

Both of these variables work the same way. If they are 0, then -q or -v was
B<not> specified. And if they are defined and greather than (>) 0, then -q or -v
were specified on the command line. You should test for greater than 0 B<not>
B<== 1>, because Fetchware takes advantage of a cool feature in GetOpt::Long
allowing the user to specify -v and -q more than once. This triggers either
$fetchware::quiet or $fetchware::verbose to be greater than one, which would
cause a direct C<== 1> test to fail even though the user is no asking for
I<more> verbose messages. Internally Fetchware only supports on verbositly
level.

=head1 DOWNLOAD SUBROUTINES

App::Fetchware::Util's download_*() and *_dirlist() subroutines allow you to
download FTP, HTTP, or local file (file://) directory listings or files
respectively. 

=over
=item NOTICE
Each  *_dirlist() subroutine returns its own format that is different from the
others. Fetchware uses the *_parse_filelist() subroutines to parse this
differing directory listings into a specifc format of an array of arrays of
filenames and timestamps. You could load these subroutines from the
C<OVERRIDE_LOOKUP> App::Fetchware export tag to use in your Fetchwarefile or
your fetchware extension.

=back

###BUGALERT### All download routines should be modified to use HTTP::Tiny's
#iterative download interface so I can write the downloaded files straight to
#disk to avoid wasting 20, 30 or 120gigs or so or whatever the file size is in

=head2 download_dirlist()

    my $dir_list = download_dirlist($url)

    my $dir_list = download_dirlist(PATH => $path)

Can be called with either a $url or a PATH parameter. When called with a $url
parameter, the specified $url is downloaded using no_mirror_download_dirlist(),
and returned if successful. If it fails then each C<mirror> the user specified
is also tried unitl there are no more mirrors, and then an exception is thrown.

If you specify a PATH parameter instead of a $url parameter, then that path is
appended to each C<mirror>, and the resultant url is downloaded using
no_mirror_download_dirlist().

=head2 download_file()

    my $filename = download_file($url)

    my $filename = download_file(PATH => $path)

Can be called with either a $url or a PATH parameter. When called with a $url
parameter, the specified $url is downloaded using no_mirror_download_file(),
and returned if successful. If it fails then each C<mirror> the user specified
is also tried unitl there are no more mirrors, and then an exception is thrown.

If you specify a PATH parameter instead of a $url parameter, then that path is
appended to each C<mirror>, and the resultant url is downloaded using
no_mirror_download_file().

simply loops over its internal listing of what is arguments should be, and then
accesses the arguments if they exist.

This was really only implemented to allow App::FetchwareX::HTMLPageSync to change
its user agent string to avoid being blocked or freaking out Web developers that
they're being screen scraped by some obnoxious bot as HTMLPageSync is wimpy and
harmless, and only downloads one page. 

You would add an argument like this:
download_http_url($http_url, agent => 'Firefox');

    OS error [$!].
    EOE

safe_open() takes $file_to_check and does a bunch of file checks on that
file to determine if it's safe to open and use the contents of that file in
your program. Instead of returning true or false, it returns a file handle of
the file you want to check that has already been open for you. This is done to
prevent race conditions between the time safe_open() checks the file's safety
and the time the caller actually opens the file.

safe_open() also takes an optional second argument that specifies a caller
specific error message that replaces the generic default one.

Fetchware occasionally needs to write files especially in fetchware's new()
command; therefore safe_open() also takes the fake hash argument
C<MODE =E<gt> 'E<gt>'>, which opens the file in a mode specified by the caller.
C<'E<gt>'> is for writing for example. See C<perldoc -f open> for a list of
possible modes.

In fetchware, this subroutine is used to check if every file fetchware
opens is safe to do so. It is based on is_safe() and is_very_safe() from the
Perl Cookbook by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington.

What this subroutine checks:

=over

=item *

It opens the file you give to it as an argument, and all subsequent operations
are done on the opened filehandle to prevent race conditions.

=item *

Then it checks that the owner of the specified file must be either the superuser
or the user who ran fetchware.

=item *

It checks that the mode, as returned by File::stat's overridden stat, is not
writable by group or other. Fancy MAC permissions such as Linux's extfs's
extensions and fancy Windows permissions are B<not> currently checked.

=item *

Then safe_open() stat's each and every parent directory that is in this file's
full path, and runs the same checks that are run above on each parent directory.

=item *

_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is not tested; instead what is_very_safe() does is simply
always done. Because even with A _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED test, /home, for example,
could be 777. This is Unix after all, and root can do anything including screw
up permissions on system directories.

=back

If you actually are some sort of security expert, please feel free to
double-check if the list of stuff to check for is complete, and perhaps even the
Perl implementation to see if the subroutien really does check if
safe_open($file_to_check) is actually safe.


=over

=item WARNING

According to L<perlport>'s chmod() documentation, on Win32 perl's Unixish file
permissions arn't supported only "owner" is:

"Only good for changing "owner" read-write access, "group", and "other" bits are
meaningless. (Win32)"

I'm not completely sure this means that under Win32 only owner perms mean
something, or if just chmod()ing group or ther bits don't do anything, but
testing if group and other are rwx does work. This needs testing.

And remember this only applies to Win32, and fetchware has not yet been properly
ported or tested under Win32 yet.

    # variables the child shared with us.
    my ($var1, $var2, ...) = read_dropprivs_pipe($output);

Forks and drops privs to $regular_user, and then executes whatever is in the
first argument, which should be a code reference. Throws an exception on any
problems with the fork.

It only allows you to specify what the lower priveledged user does. The parent
process's behavior can not be changed. All the parent does:

=over

=item *

Create a pipe to allow the child to communicate any information back to the
parent.

=item *

Read any data the child may write to that pipe.

=item *

After the child has died, collect the child's exit status.

=item *

And return the output the child wrote on the pipe as a scalar reference.

=back

Whatever the child writes is returned. drop_privs() does not use Storable or
JSON or XML or anything. It is up to you to specify how the data is to be
represented and used. However, L<read_dropprivs_pipe()> and
L<write_dropprivs_pipe()> are provided.  They provide a simple way to store
multiple variables that can have any character in them including newline. See
their documentation for details.

=over

=item SECURITY NOTICE

The output returned by drop_privs() is whatever the child wants it to be. If
somehow the child got hacked, the $output could be something that could cause
the parent (which has root perms!) to execute some code, or otherwise do
something that could cause the child to gain root access. So be sure to check
how you use drop_privs() return value, and definitley don't just string eval it.
Structure it so the return value can only be used as data for variables, and
that those variables are never executed by root.

=back

drop_privs() handles being on nonunix for you. On a platform that is not Unix
that does not have Unix's fork() and exec() security model, drop_privs() simply
executes the provided code reference I<without> dropping priveledges.

=over

=item USABILITY NOTICE 

drop_privs()'s implementation depends on start() creating a tempdir and
chdir()ing to it. Furthermore, drop_privs() sometimes creates a tempdir of its
own, and it does not do a chdir back to another directory, so drop_privs()
depends on end() to chdir back to original_cwd(). Therefore, do not use
drop_privs() without also using start() and end() to manage a temporary
directory for drop_privs().

=back

drop_privs() also supports a C<SkipTempDirCreation =E<gt> 1> option that turns
off drop_privs() creating a temporary diretory to give the child a writable
temporary directory. This option is only used by cmd_new(), and probably only
really needs to be used there. Also, note that you must provide this option
after the $child_code coderef, and the $regular user options. Like so,
C<my $output = drop_privs($child_code, $regular_user, SkipTempDirCreation =E<gt> 1>.

=head2 drop_privs() PIPE PARSING UTILITIES

drop_privs() uses a pipe for IPC between the child and the parent. This section
contains utilties that help users of drop_privs() parse the input and output

=head3 write_dropprivs_pipe()

    write_dropprivs_pipe($write_pipe, $variable1, $variable2, $variable3);

Simply uses the caller provided $write_pipe file handle to write the rest of its
args to that file handle separated by a I<magic number>.

This magic number is just generated uniquely each time App::Fetchware::Util is
compiled. This number replaces using newline to separate each of the variables
that write_dropprivs_pipe() writes. This way you can include newline, and in
fact anything that does not contain the magic number, which is obviously
suitably unlikely.

=head1 MISCELANEOUS UTILTY SUBROUTINES

This is just a catch all category for everything else in App::Fetchware::Utility.

=cut



=head2 do_nothing()

    do_nothing();

do_nothing() does nothing but return. It simply returns doing nothing. It is
meant to be used by App::Fetchware "subclasses" that "override" App::Fetchware's
API subroutines to make those API subroutines do nothing.

=cut

sub do_nothing {
    return;
}



=head1 TEMPDIR SUBROUTINES

These subroutines manage the creation of a temporary directory for you. They
also implement the original_cwd() getter subroutine that returns the current
working directory fetchware was at before create_tempdir() chdir()'d to the
temporary directory you specify. File::Temp's tempdir() is used, and
cleanup_tempdir() manages the C<fetchware.sem> fetchware semaphore file.

=over
=item NOTICE
App::Fetchware::Util's temporary directory creation utilities, create_tempdir(),
original_cwd(), and cleanup_tempdir(), only keep track of one tempdir at a time. If
you create another tempdir with create_tempdir() it will override the value of
original_cwd(), which may mess up other functions that call create_tempdir(),
original_cwd(), and cleanup_tempdir(). Therefore, becareful when you call these
functions, and do B<not> use them inside a fetchware extension if you reuse
App::Fetchware's start() and end(), because App::Fetchware's start() and end()
use these functions, so your use of them will conflict. If you still need to
create a tempdir just call File::Temp's tempdir() directly.

    # $fh_sem is a semaphore lock file that create_tempdir() creates, and
    # cleanup_tempdir() closes clearing the lock. This is used to support
    # fetchware clean. The filehandle needs to be declared outside
    # create_tempdir()'s scope, because when this filehandle goes out of scope
    # the file is closed, and the lock is released, but fetchware needs to keep
    # hold of this lock for the life of fetchware to ensure that any fetchware
    # clean won't delete this fetchware temporary directory.
    my $fh_sem;

=head2 create_tempdir()

    my $temp_dir = create_tempdir();

Creates a temporary directory, chmod 700's it, and chdir()'s into it.

Accepts the fake hash argument C<KeepTempDir => 1>, which tells create_tempdir()
to B<not> delete the temporary directory when the program exits.

Also, accepts C<TempDir =E<gt> '/tmp'> to specify what temporary directory to
use. The default with out this argument is to use tempdir()'s default, which is
whatever File::Spec's tmpdir() says to use.

The C<NoChown =E<gt> 1> option causes create_tempdir() to B<not> chown to
config('user').


=head3 Locking Fetchware's temp directories with a semaphore file.

In order to support C<fetchware clean>, create_tempdir() creates a semaphore
file. The file is used by C<fetchware clean> (via bin/fetchware's cmd_clean())
to determine if another fetchware process out there is currently using this
temporary directory, and if it is not, the file is not currently locked with
flock, then the entire directory is deleted using File::Path's remove_path()
function. If the file is there and locked, then the directory is skipped by
cmd_clean(). Note: you can call C<fetchware clean> with the -f or --force option
to force fetchware to delete B<all> fetchware temporary directories even out
from under the pants of any currently running fetchware process!

cleanup_tempdir() is responsible for unlocking the semaphore file that
create_tempdir() creates. However, the coolest part of using flock is that if
fetchware is killed in any manner whether its C<END> block or File::Temp's
C<END>block run, the OS will still unlock the file, so no edge cases need
handling, because the OS will do them for us!

It also closes $fh_sem, which is the filehandle of the 'fetchware.sem' file

App::Fetchware::Util holds miscelaneous utilities that fetchware needs for
various purposes such as logging and controling executed processes based on -q
or -v switches (msg(), vmsg(), run_prog()), subroutines for downloading
directory listings (*_dirlist()) or files (download_*()) using ftp, http, or
local files (file://), do_nothing() for extensions to fetchware, and subroutines
for managing a temporary directory.

As with the rest of App::Fetchware, App::Fetchware::Util does not return any
error codes; instead, all errors are die()'d if it's App::Fetchware::Util's
error, or croak()'d if its the caller's fault. These exceptions are simple
strings, and are listed in the L</DIAGNOSTICS> section below.

=head1 BUGS 

App::Fetchware::Util's temporary directory creation utilities, create_tempdir(),
original_cwd(), and cleanup_tempdir(), only keep track of one tempdir at a time. If
you create another tempdir with create_tempdir() it will override the value of
original_cwd(), which may mess up other functions that call create_tempdir(),
original_cwd(), and cleanup_tempdir(). Therefore, be careful when you call these
functions, and do B<not> use them inside a fetchware extension if you reuse
App::Fetchware's start() and end(), because App::Fetchware's start() and end()
use these functions, so your use of them will conflict. If you still need to
create a tempdir just call File::Temp's tempdir() directly.
