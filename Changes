Revison History for App::Fetchware

{{$NEXT}}
    * Fixed numerous simple test failures reported automatically from CPAN
      Testers.
      * See: http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/A/App-Fetchware.html for listing
        of failed test reports. All of them failed :) Be sure to select the
        reports for version 1.00, which corresponds to the version of fetchware
        that was tested.
    * Replaced given/when with regular ifs due to 5.18 deprecation of given/when. 
      * RIP given/when and smartmatch and ~~. With any luck you'll be
        reincarnated soon.
