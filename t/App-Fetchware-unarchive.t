App-Fetchware: run-time error. The archive you asked fetchware to download has
one or more files with an absolute path. Absolute paths in archives is
dangerous, because the files could potentially overwrite files anywhere in the
filesystem including important system files. That is why this is a fatal error
that cannot be ignored. See perldoc App::Fetchware.

App-Fetchware: run-time warning. The archive you asked Fetchware to download 
does *not* have *all* of its files in one and only one containing directory.
This is not a problem for fetchware, because it does all of its downloading,
unarchive, and building in a temporary directory that makes it easy to
automatically delete all of the files when fetchware is done with them. See
perldoc App::Fetchware.
