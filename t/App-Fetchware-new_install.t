# This lame hack is, so that I can test my use of Term::UI, which is just as
# untestable as Term::ReadLine with which it is based. Term::UI tests itself
# using this exact same method except it uses a default option, but I do not
# want my calls to have a default option or add some stupid wrapper to do it for
# me. This works just fine. Just remember to ignore the warning:
# You have '$AUOTREPLY' set to true, but did not provide a default!

#create a interactive option for this test file similar to what Term::ReadLine
#itself does. At least add an xt/ and FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING test that
#prints a lame reminder to at least test new() manually using fetchware new
#itself.
